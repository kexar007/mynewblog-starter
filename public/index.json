When you open this page, the image is displayed as a large hero banner at the top (depending on your layout settings).\nWhy use Featured Images?\r#\rVisual Appeal: They make your blog index look professional. Social Media: When you share this link on Twitter or LinkedIn, this image will show up in the preview card. Context: It sets the mood for the article before the reader starts reading. How to switch to a local image?\r#\rRight now, this post is using a URL from Unsplash. To make it local:\nCreate a folder named featured-demo inside content/posts/. Rename this file to index.md and move it inside that folder. Paste your own image into that folder and name it featured.jpg. Remove the image: \u0026quot;...\u0026quot; line from the top of this file. That\u0026rsquo;s it! Blowfish loves \u0026ldquo;Page Bundles\u0026rdquo; (folders with an index.md and images inside).\n","date":"30 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/feaured-demo-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Beauty of Mountains","type":"posts"},{"content":"This is a kitchen sink post.
